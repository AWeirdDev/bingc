# bingc(hillin)
Bing search scraper written in üêç Python‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬ÆÔ∏è (üî•üî•üî•).

Why?

- **Extremely lightweight**. Bingc is based on `selectolax` for HTML parsing and `primp` for HTTP request browser impersonation that's based on `rquest`.
- **Ultra fast & robust**. While Bingc is written in Python, we carefully selected those two dependencies to smooth out everything: one is written in Rust and the other is written in C (w/ CPython).
- **Strongly typed**. Bingc is typed everywhere and has a clean, idiomatic API.
- **Asynchronous support**. Functions begin with the letter `a` is wrapped with `asyncify`.
- **John Cena**. You can't see me (on PyPi, probably).


Bingc APIs are organized by their API category. For example, if you'd like to fetch the latest news from Bing from [this page](https://www.bing.com/news) (where there's no query parameters), we call it `landing`. Therefore, to use the `news()` call, you'd do:

```python
from bingc import landing

# Get latest news
landing.news()

# Get search suggestions (q is optional)
landing.suggest(q="why.")
```
